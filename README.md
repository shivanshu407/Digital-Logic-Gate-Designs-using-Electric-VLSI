# **Digital Logic Gate Designs using Electric VLSI**  

This repository contains **logic gate layouts and circuit designs** created using **Electric VLSI Design System**. The designs are useful for **VLSI design, circuit verification, and custom IC layout**.  

## **Features**  
- Designed and simulated using **Electric VLSI**.  
- Includes essential **logic gates** and a **full adder** layout.  
- Stored in **.jelib format**, which is compatible with **Electric VLSI software**.  

## **Contents**  
The repository includes the following logic circuits:  

### **Basic Logic Gates**  
- **AND Gate (AND.jelib)**  
- **OR Gate (OR.jelib)**  
- **NAND Gate (NAND.jelib)**  
- **NOR Gate (NOR.jelib)**  
- **XOR Gate (XOR.jelib)**  
- **XNOR Gate (XNOR.jelib)**  
- **Inverter (inverter.jelib)**  

### **Combinational Circuit**  
- **Full Adder (FULL ADDER.jelib)**  

### **Additional Files**  
- **layout_nand.spi** - SPICE file for NAND gate simulation.  

## **Usage**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Digital-Logic-ElectricVLSI.git
